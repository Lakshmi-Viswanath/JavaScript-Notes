HOF - Higher order functions
Functions which takes another functions as argument is called higher order functions or return a function.
Callback is a function that is passed as a parameter to higher order function

Array functions
1. Arrays are also custom objects in JS.
2. Index of the element is the key and element itself is the value.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
map function
1.map is a higher order fucntion available with arrays . It takes function as the argument 
2.it returns an array in which every value is actually populated by calling function f 
with original array element as argument

------------------------------------------------------------------------
filter function
1. it is also a hof and also loops over the array element. 
2. the argument function f which we have to pass inside filter should always return a boolen 
otherwise it will convert to boolen
3. if the output of the function call is true it stores the original element ina new array otherwise does 
not add this element to the array.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
reduce function
1. also an hof which takes a function f as a argument.
2. reduce will pass the element to the function f and accumulate the result of further function calls with 
the previous result

Callback problems
1. callback hell - nested callbacks making code hard to read and debug leading to pyramid structure.
2. inversion of control - trust issues means callback will be called or not executed. Passing of control of your 
function to someones else implemented function.
