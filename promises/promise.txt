1. Promises solve inversion of control and readability enhancers
2. Promises are objects that get returened immediately when called.
3. it acts as a placeholder for the data we want to get.
4. promise objects can be attached with the functionality we want to execute 
when future task is done.
5. once future task is done promises will automatically execute the attached functions.

How to create a promise?
Promise are synchronoua are in nature.
It ca be in 3 states
1. pending - its default state with work in progress.
2. fullfilled - completed its execution
3. Rejected - operation was not successful

Syntax
new promise(function (resolve, reject){
    //some task
})

when executor callback executes resolve function the promise goes to fulfilled state, 
when reject function is called it goes to rejected state otherwise remains in the pending 
state.
with whatever argument we call resolve or reject , the value property gets assigned with it,
and value of pending  state is undefined.
The executor function is synchronus in nature.
