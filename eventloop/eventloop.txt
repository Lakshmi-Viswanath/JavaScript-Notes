Java Script is single threaded and synchronus in nature
Java Script has some native code and some is run in the run time 

JS has a callstack, multiple queue , run time environment and event queue.
The event loop is an infinite loop which keeps checking for if the call stact us empty.
JS never gives priority to asynchronus code over its native code and global code execution. 
Means JS first executes its native JS code and then executes the asynchronus code.
